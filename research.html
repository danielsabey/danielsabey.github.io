                    After increasing in the 1970s and 1980s, time to bachelor's degree has declined since the 1990s. We document this fact using data from three nationally representative surveys. We show that this pattern is occurring across school types and for all student types. Using administrative student records from 10 large universities, we confirm the finding and show that it is robust to alternative sample definitions. We discuss what might explain the decline in time to bachelor's degree by considering trends in student preparation, state funding, student enrollment, study time, and student employment during college.

                    <strong>Question.</strong> What was the association of recent Medicaid expansion in Maine on the volume and quality of child maltreatment reporting, and how did associations differ across children's characteristics?

                    <br><br><strong>Findings.</strong> In this cohort study of 25,307,932 maltreatment reports across 38 states, Medicaid expansion in Maine led to increased overall reporting, particularly from medical professionals, resulting in increased separations at lower substantiation rates. Associations were stronger among Black and female children.

                    <br><br><strong>Meaning.</strong> Our results suggest recent Medicaid expansions are associated with increased maltreatment reporting and intervention at lower specificity, resulting in a greater rate of unsubstantiated separations of children from their caregivers.

                    This study investigates whether teachers' effectiveness in teaching specific student groups is an innate skill or a learned ability. Research has shown significant variance in teacher value-added measures across different student demographics, prior performance levels, and various educational outcomes, underscoring the importance of understanding these differences. The research examines how exogenous differences in classroom compositions impact teacher value-added measures for different types of students, focusing on three key student characteristics: race, performance level (above or below median), and socioeconomic status. By analyzing longitudinal data on teacher performance and student outcomes, we seek to identify patterns of improvement in teacher effectiveness across these student subgroups over time. This research has significant implications for teacher training, professional development, and classroom assignment policies. The study will utilize NCERDC's comprehensive teacher and student data, including teacher demographics, qualifications, and experience, as well as student demographic information, academic performance, and classroom assignments. By leveraging these rich datasets, we aim to isolate the effects of exogenous differences in classroom composition on teacher learning for different student subgroups. The findings from this study could inform more targeted approaches to teacher development and potentially lead to improved educational outcomes for diverse student populations, particularly in addressing achievement gaps related to race, prior performance, and socioeconomic status.
