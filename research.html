                    After increasing in the 1970s and 1980s, time to bachelor's degree has declined since the 1990s. We document this fact using data from three nationally representative surveys. We show that this pattern is occurring across school types and for all student types. Using administrative student records from 10 large universities, we confirm the finding and show that it is robust to alternative sample definitions. We discuss what might explain the decline in time to bachelor's degree by considering trends in student preparation, state funding, student enrollment, study time, and student employment during college.

                    <strong>Question.</strong> What was the association of recent Medicaid expansion in Maine on the volume and quality of child maltreatment reporting, and how did associations differ across children's characteristics?

                    <br><br><strong>Findings.</strong> In this cohort study of 25,307,932 maltreatment reports across 38 states, Medicaid expansion in Maine led to increased overall reporting, particularly from medical professionals, resulting in increased separations at lower substantiation rates. Associations were stronger among Black and female children.

                    <br><br><strong>Meaning.</strong> Our results suggest recent Medicaid expansions are associated with increased maltreatment reporting and intervention at lower specificity, resulting in a greater rate of unsubstantiated separations of children from their caregivers.

                    This paper investigates the "temptation effect" – whether increased readily available cigarette stock causally increases smoking intensity. We leverage the unprecedented natural experiment of the COVID-19 pandemic using Nielsen household scanner data, Advan Patterns cell phone data, and USAfacts.org COVID-19 data. An Interrupted Time Series (ITS) model reveals COVID having a sharp and persistent increases in both cigarette stockpiles and smoking rates. Exploration of linked survey data highlights heterogeneous responses related to stress and household characteristics. To isolate the causal effect of stock, we use county-level changes in mobility as an instrumental variable (IV) for changes in cigarette stock. The IV estimates suggest that a one-pack increase in instrumented stock causally increases daily smoking by approximately one cigarette.

                <div class="panel">
                    This study investigates whether teachers' effectiveness in teaching specific student groups is an innate skill or a learned ability. Building on the established findings that teacher performance improves most in the first few years and that teachers exhibit comparative advantages for different student types, this paper explores if early-career classroom composition shapes a teacher's long-term effectiveness. The research examines how conditionally exogenous classroom compositions during a teacher's first three years impact their later value-added measures across various student demographics (race, sex, prior performance, and socioeconomic status). Using data from Columbus City Schools and the North Carolina Education Research Data Center (NCERDC), the study analyzes multiple outcomes, including test scores, behavioral incidents, and long-term achievements like high school graduation. By isolating the impact of early-career experiences, the research aims to distinguish between static "role model" effects and dynamic, learnable teaching skills, offering significant implications for teacher training and allocation policies.

                <div class="panel">
                    This paper explores methods to optimize teacher-student pairings by moving beyond single value-added metrics. It investigates which student characteristics (race, sex, prior performance, etc.) offer the greatest potential for gains when matching teachers based on their comparative advantages. The research introduces a novel method for classifying student "types" based on their past performance with different teachers and compares the effectiveness of traditional value-added models against higher-dimensional machine learning predictions for creating optimal classroom assignments. The paper also considers the welfare implications of reassigning students to teachers, rather than teachers to classes, and proposes an RCT to test these matching strategies in a real-world setting.

                    This project examines how predictive algorithms could be used to identify and help K-6 students who are at risk of academic setbacks. These setbacks include failing a class, scoring below proficiency on state exams, and failing to meet attendance requirements. This project will develop a machine learning (ML) tool to predict K-6 students’ risk of academic setbacks, and introduce the ML tool to six K-6 schools in a staggered-rollout RCT. We will use student data and teacher surveys to evaluate how the tool, and certain aspects of its implementation, affect student outcomes and teacher beliefs/effort, as well as to compare ML and teacher predictions. We hope to learn when a ML tool can add value in identifying at-risk students, and how the tool can be implemented to maximize improvement of student outcomes.
